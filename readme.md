There's a flower in Minecraft mod Botania called Dandelifion. It uses modified
Game of Life rules to generate mana, sort of energy system in Botania. Mana is 
generated from alive cells when they enter neighbouring blocks around flower.
The goal of this repo is to use genetics algorithm to find the optimal starting 
placement of blocks (Game of life's cells) that will generate maximum amount of
mana. If you are looking for simple game where you can place blocks manually and
run the Dandelifion simulation to calculate how much mana you get, switch to 
[simple game](https://github.com/DreadBoy/dandelifeon/tree/simple-game) branch.
